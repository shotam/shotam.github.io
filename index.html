          		I am a post-doctoral researcher working with <a href="https://profiles.ucsd.edu/tamar.gollan">Tamar Gollan</a> and <a href="https://psychology.ucsd.edu/people/profiles/vferreira.html">Victor Ferreira</a> at the University of California, San Diego. I study how people assemble sentence structures in speaking and understanding using their knowledge of language. Before UCSD, I did my Ph.D. in Linguistics at the University of Maryland with <a href="http://www.colinphillips.net/"> Colin Phillips </a> and <a href="http://lmcl.umd.edu/people.html"> Robert Slevc </a>. Before that, I did a B.S. in Psychology and B.A. in Linguistics at the University of Washington, Seattle, where I worked in <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/losterho/erplab.htm"> Lee Osterhout's Cognitive Neuroscience of language lab. </a> </p>

	    		Understanding and speaking our native language seem effortless, but they actually involve complex, mostly unconscious cognitive processes. One of such cognitive processes is parsing in understanding and generation in speaking, the process of building mental representations of sentence structures necessary for systematic interpretation and grammatical production. Historically, parsing and generation are studied largely independently in psycholinguistics, perhaps because they look superficially distinct. For instance, some aphasics can comprehend but not speak grammatically complex sentences. As a consequence psycholinguists have two largely unrelated models of structural processes in comprehension and production. My research aims to unify them. This attempt has led me to study various aspects of cognition, including syntactic and semantic processes, prediction, planning, long-term memory, working memory, using multiple languages (English, Japanese) and methodologies (EEG, novel and existing behavioral methods).
