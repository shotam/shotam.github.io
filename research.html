	    		<h1> Vision <b> 展望 </b> </h1>
	    		<p>
	    		Humans use their linguistic knowledge in at least two ways. On one hand, they use their linguistic knowledge to convey what they mean to others or to themselves. On the other hand, they use their linguistic knowledge to understand what others say or they themselves say. In either case, they must assemble the syntactic structures of sentences in a systematic fashion, in accordance with the grammar of their language.
        		The empirical question I focus on is whether there are two mechanisms for structure building, one for comprehension and the other for production, or a single structure building mechanism underlies both comprehension and production. My research aims to develop an integrated model of structure building in sentence comprehension and sentence production that can be directly connected to the theories of grammar. Toward this goal, I use whatever methods that are suitable in answering relevant questions, including novel and existing behavioral methods and electroencephalography (EEG).
        		
        		<p>
        		<b><i>Why care?</i></b>
        		This is the question that in my opinion should be asked for every single research question in science. Here is my stab at explaining why you should care about integrating the model of structure building in sentence comprehension and production (excerpt from one of my recent paper with slight modifications; Momma & Phillips, 2017, Annual reviews in linguistics) 
        		</p>
        		<p>
        		Understanding the relation between models of structure building in comprehension and production is central to the larger project of connecting high-level linguistic theories with psycholinguistic theories. In relating psycholinguistic and linguistic theories it is important to distinguish three dimensions: tasks, levels of analysis, and mechanisms.
				</p>
				<p>
				<i>Tasks</i>: It is clear that we carry out different tasks using our linguistic knowledge. When we speak we start with an intended meaning and try to find an external form that conveys that meaning. When we understand we start with an external form and try to identify the intended meaning. When we make acceptability judgments we take a form-meaning pairing and try to identify whether they are connected. All three tasks have a shared subgoal of building a structure that links the form and the meaning. They differ only in what information is provided as a starting point.
				</p>
				<p>
				<i>Levels of analysis</i>: The same cognitive system can be described at multiple levels of analysis. Traditional linguistic theories are theories of mental representations, but they abstract away from details of timing, how those representations are encoded in memory, neural connectivity, etc. It is common to appeal to the three levels proposed by Marr (1982) for analyses of visual systems, but Marr’s levels do not correspond closely to standard practice in linguistics and psycholinguistics. It is probably more accurate to view levels of analysis on a continuum, with as many different levels as there are details that can be included or abstracted away from.
				</p>
				<p>
				<i>Mechanisms</i>: The distinctions among tasks and among levels of analysis are necessary, and accounts of speaking, understanding, and acceptability judgment tend to focus on different tasks and on different levels of analysis. But this does not amount to the claim that distinct cognitive mechanisms build the same representations for different tasks, i.e., a parser that builds structures in comprehension, a generator that builds structures in production, and a grammar that is shared between these, and also plays a central role in acceptability judgments. One can distinguish tasks and levels of analysis without committing to distinct mechanisms.
				</p>
				<p>
				In other work it has been argued that is beneficial and feasible to treat the structure building system used in comprehension and the grammar as the same cognitive system (Phillips 1996; Phillips & S. Lewis 2013). Evidence that the distinction is unnecessary comes from two broad domains. First, rapid structure building processes during comprehension are highly grammatically sensitive (Phillips et al. 2011; S. Lewis & Phillips 2015). Second, there may be benefits for standard grammatical analysis from assuming a structure building system that proceeds in the same order as comprehension and production processes (Bianchi & Chesi 2014; Kempson et al. 2001; Phillips 2003; Shan & Barker 2006; Steedman 2000). However, there is little benefit in conflating the parser and the grammar if the parser and the generator cannot also be conflated. In fact, if the parser and the generator are distinct cognitive mechanisms that assemble the same representations, then it is necessary to have a third cognitive mechanism that defines the possible representations, i.e., a grammar. In other words, the choice is between one cognitive mechanism or three. Two is not an option.
