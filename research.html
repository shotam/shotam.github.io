	    		<h1> Vision <b> 展望 </b> </h1>
	    		<p>
	    		Humans use their linguistic knowledge in at least two ways. On one hand, they use their linguistic knowledge to convey what they mean to others or to themselves. On the other hand, they use their linguistic knowledge to understand what others say or they themselves say. In either case, they must assemble the syntactic structures of sentences in a systematic fashion, in accordance with the grammar of their language.
        		The empirical question I focus on is whether there are two mechanisms for structure building, one for comprehension and the other for production, or a single structure building mechanism underlies both comprehension and production. My research aims to develop an integrated model of structure building in sentence comprehension and sentence production that can be directly connected to the theories of grammar. Toward this goal, I use whatever methods that are suitable in answering relevant questions, including novel and existing behavioral methods and electroencephalography (EEG).
        		
        		<p>
        		<b><i>Why care?</i></b>
        		Excellent question. This is the question that in my opinion should be asked for every single research question in science. Here is my <a href="http://www.colinphillips.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/momma_phillips2017.pdf">stab</a>.
